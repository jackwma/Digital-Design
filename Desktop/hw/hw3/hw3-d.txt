The DBMS that we use in this assignment is running somewhere in one of Microsoft's data centers.
Comment on your experience using this DBMS cloud service. What do you think about the idea of offering a DBMS
as a service in a public cloud?

I feel like DMBS as a service in a public cloud would provide a lot of convenience for those who are interested in researching with the data on the go and also without interference from corporate control. One thing I would worry about is security. For example, a social media giant like Facebook has data on millions of people around the globe and it would really be detrimental if the data had been in the control of hackers.
